# Opportunist | Curated opportunities in technology

How often we come across exciting opportunities in technology like open source programs, mentorship programs, scholarships and much more, only to find out that we've missed the deadline! 

Presenting Opportunist, a one stop location for all the tech enthusiasts eager to kick start their careers and participate in world class programs. All you need to do is enter some basic details, and based on that you get the list and details of all the opportunities you are eligible and can apply for. 

That's not all. There is also a collection of some very informative and curated blogs by experienced people, which can guide you on the application process or learn more about the program. 

Finally, if you're interested in helping out others and making a solid impact, then you're most welcome to do so by sharing the opportunities that you're aware of, on the Suggest section. This will then be reviewed and added to our database. 

Please note that this project is still in its development phase and might have some shortcomings. Everyone is encouraged to make contributions to this repository, send pull requests and help students have a better experience while using this tool.
